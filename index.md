# **Xiaoye Zuo**'s ~~Lab1~~ User Page
## Hello there! My name's 晓晔 and I'm a senior major in computer engineering with a minor in business. I'm from Chongqing, China. When I'm not coding(which is most of the time), I'm probably reading, hiking, cooking, or wandering around random streets.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;  Random things about me:
- My favorite drink is water

### &nbsp;&nbsp;  Fun fact 
` git ` is a curse word in British slang

### &nbsp;&nbsp;  My preferred programming languages:
1. Python: easy syntax + abundant libraries
2. C/C++: fast execution + wide application
3. MATLAB: easy visualization
