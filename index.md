# **Xiaoye Zuo**'s ~~Lab1~~ User Page
## Hello there! My name's **晓晔** and I'm a senior major in computer engineering with a minor in business. I'm from Chongqing, China. When I'm not coding(which is most of the time), I'm probably reading, hiking, cooking, or wandering around random streets.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;  Random things about me:
- My favorite drink is water

3. MATLAB: easy visualization

- [ ] Familiarity with software development process
- [ ] More advanced coding skills
- [ ] Have fun and meet new friends
